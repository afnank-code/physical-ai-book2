# Specification: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive, AI-native technical textbook that introduces students to the landscape of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.

## Core Modules (Specifications)
1. **Module 1: ROS 2 (The Nervous System)**
   - Focus on DDS, nodes, and communication.
2. **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**
   - Specifying physics simulation, gravity, and sensor modeling.
3. **Module 3: The AI Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**
   - Specifying hardware-accelerated perception and VSLAM.
4. **Module 4: VLA Models**
   - Specifying the convergence of LLMs and robotics for embodied intelligence.

## AI Generation Methodology
- **Tools**: Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus.
- **Approach**: All markdown files in `/docs` are generated based on these technical specifications to ensure consistency and technical accuracy.
