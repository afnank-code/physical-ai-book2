# Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

The final project represents the culmination of all modules, where students integrate their knowledge of ROS 2, simulation, NVIDIA Isaac, and VLA models into a single autonomous system.

## 1. Project Objective
The goal is to develop a simulated humanoid robot that can receive a natural language voice command, navigate through a complex environment, identify a specific object, and perform a physical interaction.

## 2. Technical Requirements
To succeed in the capstone, the following system components must be integrated:
* **Voice-to-Action**: Implement OpenAI Whisper to translate speech commands into text intent.
* **Cognitive Planning**: Use an LLM to decompose commands into a sequence of ROS 2 actions.
* **Autonomous Navigation**: Utilize Isaac ROS and Nav2 for path planning and dynamic obstacle avoidance.
* **Perception**: Identify the target object using computer vision and multimodal reasoning.



## 3. Evaluation Criteria
Projects will be evaluated based on:
1. **System Integration**: How well the "brain" (Isaac/VLA) communicates with the "body" (ROS 2/Gazebo).
2. **Robustness**: The robot's ability to handle unexpected obstacles or variations in the environment.
3. **Accuracy**: Precise object identification and successful manipulation.

## Summary
The Autonomous Humanoid capstone proves the student's mastery of Physical AI principles, moving from digital intelligence to embodied intelligence in a physical space.
